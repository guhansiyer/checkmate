# checkmate

Checkmate is a chess scorekeeper that records real life games of chess in the Portable Game Notation (PGN) format, and uploads them directly to Lichess for user analysis. It is written in Python, and heavily utilizes the OpenCV, NumPY, PYAutoGUI and Pillow libraries, along with the Lichess API. 

Chess has persisted as a game for hundreds of years, and has evolved accordingly. Modern chess has gained immense popularity and is enjoyed by a wide audience of people, bringing with it innovation to the game. Of these innovations, chess servers such as Chess.com and Lichess have revolutionized the game of chess, as they bring the ability to play chess without a physical board. With this capability, chess servers can also act as scorekeepers for said games, and provide move-by-move analysis. 

While virtual chess has become increasingly prevalent, games on physical boards remain the most popular way to play chess. However, those who play physical games lose the benefit of error-less scorekeeping and move analysis. Checkmate seeks to provide this benefit to physical games of chess.
